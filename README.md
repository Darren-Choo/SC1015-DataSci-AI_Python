## Problem Definition

- To build a model that best predicts the life ladder of different countries considering various regression models.

## Models Used

1. Multivariate Linear Regression 
2. Random Forest Regression
3. eXtreme Gradient Boosting Regression

## Data Preparation and Cleaning
- MISSING

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- MISSING


## Data Driven Insights and recommendations
- Random forest regression is the best model to predict life ladder across all the 3 models we used.

## What did we learn from this project?
- Learnt to apply K-fold cross-validation in our project.
- Handling datasets with missing and irrelavant data.
