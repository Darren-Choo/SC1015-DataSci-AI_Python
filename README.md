## Problem Definition

- To build a model that best predicts the life ladder of different countries considering various regression models.


## Models Used

1. Multivariate Linear Regression 
2. Random Forest Regression
3. eXtreme Gradient Boosting Regression

## Conclusion
- Random forest regression is the best model to predict life ladder across all the 3 models we used.
